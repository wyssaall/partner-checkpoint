# Lab Phase – Project Partnership and Topic Submission
## Partner:
I am working with Salim as my partner for the Lab Phase project.

## Project Topic:
We have chosen the project “Madrassati”.

## Brief Description:
Madrassati will be a platform to help parents track their children's school life. The system will include features like:

Student profiles and attendance

Grades and report cards

Messaging between parents and teachers

School announcements and events

Our goal is to create a simple, user-friendly tool that connects schools and families more effectively.
